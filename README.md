A food-ordering app built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a comprehensive solution for ordering food online. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, the app aims to simplify the food ordering process for users and enhance their overall experience.

By leveraging the MERN Stack, the app benefits from the strengths of each component. MongoDB serves as the database, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of food items, user information, and order details. Express.js provides a robust backend framework, facilitating the handling of HTTP requests and enabling seamless communication between the client and the server.

React.js, a popular frontend library, powers the app's dynamic and interactive user interface. It enables the creation of reusable UI components, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience. Node.js serves as the runtime environment, allowing for efficient server-side execution.

Through the app, users can browse through a wide range of food options, customize their orders, and seamlessly place them for delivery or pickup. The app also incorporates features such as user authentication, cart management, order tracking, and an admin panel to enhance the overall user experience and provide a feature-rich platform.

With a focus on scalability and performance, the app utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management, ensuring a predictable and efficient flow of data throughout the application. Axios is employed for handling HTTP requests, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and the backend.

## Dependency
- Redux toolkit
- react-router-dom
- react
- Axios
- parcel
- tailwind css
- react toastify

## Technologies used
- **Tailwind**: We are using the *tailwind* CSS library for styling our app. Tailwind provides a utility-first approach to CSS, allowing us to quickly build responsive and customizable UI components.

- **Redux-Toolkit**: Redux toolkit is used for creating a central store, managing the application state, and handling actions and reducers efficiently. It simplifies the process of working with Redux by providing a set of opinionated tools and guidelines.

- **Parcel**: We are using *Parcel* as a bundler for our application. Parcel is a zero-configuration bundler that provides a simple and intuitive setup, allowing us to bundle our code and assets seamlessly. It supports various file types and automatically handles dependencies.
